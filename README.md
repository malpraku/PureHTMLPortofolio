# PureHTMLPortofolio

A portofolio webpage that I've made using Pure-HTML, without the help of Bootstrap or anything. Other than Google Fonts for perfecting the Interface of course. Just a simple project in the beginning of my journey in RPL :/



## Installation

Just use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to start the local server.
Put the file inside the htdocs folder, and access it with localhost. No need to be complicated. :/
